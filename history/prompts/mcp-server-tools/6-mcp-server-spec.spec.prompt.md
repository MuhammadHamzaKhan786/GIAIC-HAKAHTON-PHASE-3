## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record for the MCP Server & Task Tooling Layer specification creation. The stage is 'spec', title should be 'mcp-server-spec', and the feature name is 'mcp-server-tools'. Include the full user prompt that started this process and a concise response about creating the specification.

## Response snapshot

Created a Prompt History Record for the MCP Server & Task Tooling Layer specification creation with ID 6, titled 'mcp-server-spec', in the 'mcp-server-tools' feature directory. The record follows the required template format with appropriate metadata and file location.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR documenting the MCP server tools specification creation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 1 new PHR file created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with MCP server implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Proper PHR creation process followed with correct directory structure

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard PHR creation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin actual MCP server spec implementation
